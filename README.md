## Assignment
CSS Assignment
Use external CSS to design this template file. Don't use inline or internal CSS.
1. Don't use table.
2. Use CSS based rows and columns
3. Use unordered list to display the menu and footer items
4. Use following color codes
     a) Green = #0b4d14; 
     b) Black = #000;
     c) Gray = #c6bfbf;
5. Use CSS positioning to fix the positions of menu, content and footer.
6. All links on this page can refer to #.
7. Use lorem ipsum to display the content.

Fonts:
•	You should use any of these three fonts which are "Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif".

Lists:
•	Make sure the spacing of your lists and list items works well with the styling of the overall page. Each list item should  have the same line-height as a paragraph line, and each list should have the same spacing at its top and bottom as you have between paragraphs.
•	Give your list items a nice bullet, appropriate for the design of the page. It is up to you whether you choose a custom bullet image or something else.
